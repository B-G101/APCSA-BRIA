## Unit 1 Vocab to Remember
- **class header** - consists of the class keyword and the name of the class
- **Main:** method that is an entry point into any Java program
    - It specifies the syntax for the Java Virtual Machine (which runs the Java code) 
- **public static void main (String[] args)**
    - Public: meaning that JVM can identify it
    - Static: means that there is only one type of this method and it will be shared
    - Void: there is nothing returned from the main method
    - String[] args: the main method’s input parameter is an array of type String. The command line arguments are stored as Strings 
- **Java methods** are blocks of code that are only executed when the specific method is called
    - Methods can be useful when you need to reuse code and break code into smaller chunks
    - Methods return an object
- The two types of methods are user-defined methods and standard library methods
    - User defined: methods we create to perform specific tasks
    - Standard library methods: methods included in Java libraries
- When creating a new object, **inheritance** is the concept that allows you to have this new object build upon the attributes of an existing object. When an object inherits from another, the new object is known to have an "is-a" relationship with the parent object
- **superclass:** the class that the new class inherits from is generally called the parent or super class 
- **subclass:** the class that inherits from the superclass 
- **Argument:** value passed to a method or constructor when the method or constructor is called
- **Object:** an instance of a class
- **class:** a programmer-defined blueprint from which objects are created
- **Parameter:** a variable in the method signature that defines the type of value to receive when the method is called
