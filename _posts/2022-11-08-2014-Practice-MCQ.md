## Corrections
| Question # | Correct Answer | Answer I Chose | Why I got it wrong/Reflection |
|---|---|---|---|
| Q15: isSorted 1D int array implementations | A | E | Option 3 was not correct because the loop only analyzes data[0] and data [1] not the rest of the elements in the list. The data will return after it checks only the first two values meaning that it will return true when it still might be in decreasing order. |
| Q18: Generate random index for ArrayList | B | A | I didn’t notice that the -1 was outside of the parenthesis, which would result in data that does not fall in the length of the Arraylist. I also was unsure about size() method and I thought that is would be the same as the length() method. |
| Q19: Compound expression using 7 and variables a, b | B | D | I am still a little bit confused on De Morgan’s Law and how the and switches to an or, but other than that the question was clear to me. I think I have to go back and review that part of Collegeboard curriculum. |
| Q23: manipulate method and animals List | B | D | I was confused by the syntax in this question and what specifically the code means. I think I have to review Arraylists and the specific syntax and methods for them since they are kind of confusing for me. |
| Q33: Print sum after while loop | E | C | The loop never terminates because k is not being added to or removed from. |
| Q39: recur method with int parameter | D | E | The value of recur(9) is 18. However, this call was made within another recursive call and is not the final return value. |
| Q40 whatsItDo with String parameter and substrings | C | D | When whatsItDo(“W”) is called, nothing is printed since the print occurs in the if statement which does not execute. All previous recursive method calls print a substring of str and not str. |

## Trimester Reflection
This trimester was quite the struggle for me to keep up with the work during the class period. Last year I feel like a I got really good at Python, Javascript, and HTML, so converting that background knowledge into Java has been more of a challenge. I think I could get better at recognizing the syntax and learning about when to use which constructors when. Another thing that was more of a struggle for me was learning about object oriented coding. As of now I feel more confident recognizing when a class is being used, how to initialize my own class, what attributes and methods are, and how to develop my own methods to classes. I also feel better about inheritance frmo other classes and how to use that. I think I could get better and recognizing what the actual algortithmns are doing for the code and learning about the different built in methods that Java has. I think another strength I have gotten better at this trimester is going persistent and working to make sure that the code works as it is supposed. I was backend developer this trimester, so I had to figure out a lot of API issues and how to fetch data from the backend to the frontend. I struggled a lot with small syntax errors which would break my code a lot. Something that I hope to get better at next trimester is the deployment part of our website. This trimester I did not deploy and work with deployment as much as I would have liked to, so I am hoping that next trimester I can work on that.
