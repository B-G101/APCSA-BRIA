# Bria's CS Interest

I initally took my first CS class because my dad is a software engineer and considering how everything in our current society is heavily focused on technology, I thought that being in a computer science class would be beneficially to my future. Not only did I enjoy my first year in the class, but I soon realized that coding has something for everyone. Though I may not be the most technically skilled individual, being in computer science has taught me the value of problem solving, creativity, and being proactive which are skills I know I can apply into any career I enter in the future. 


### Interests in CS

I think this class has taught me that I am very interesting in data structures despite the fact that I am not the best at them. I love working at a problem until it works and figuring out a code problem is just a little bit more rewarding when you do it on your own. So problem solving and debugging are also skills that I am geniunely interested in from this class. I also am very interesting in the user interface and ux design aspect of computer science. We don't really do a lot of it in this class, but it's still something that I am super interested in learning and applying more in this class. Especially because user interface is the difference between someone continuing to view your website or someone immediately clicking off your website.
