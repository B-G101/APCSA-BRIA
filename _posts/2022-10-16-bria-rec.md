# Bria's Favorite Moments in CS

Hello Mr. Mortenson! I just wanna start off this post by thanking you for being open to writing me a letter of recommendation. Computer science was a class that I wasn't sure about taking during high school, but my dad encouraged me to take it early on to try and get ahend. Being in your class has taught me everything I know about computer science and I'm super grateful that I got the opportunity to be in this class. I've met so many super cool comp sci nerds and have learned so many programming, communicative, and soft skills that I know will be valuable in my life. With that being said here are my top 5 favorite moments from computer science:

1. Coding my create task.
2. Images lab from last year. This was my first time really working with arrays and images, and I love working through the code and figuring out how to grayscale the images on my own. Though what I loved most about this project was how much failure we had to work through with my computer. I don't remember what the specific error was, but for some reason, despite the code being exactly the same as yours, my images would not show up on my website. I remember being super frusterated, and spending a bunch of class periods double checking my code versus your to see what I was doing wrong. Throughout the whole process, you were super helpful and figured out the issue was with the windows directories not finding the images properly. This was one of my favorite moments because it definetely made me feel more comfortable asking questions in the classroom and asking you more questions.
