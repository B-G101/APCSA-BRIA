<p>This trimester was quite the struggle for me to keep up with the work during the class period. Last year I feel like a I got really good at Python, Javascript, and HTML, so converting that background knowledge into Java has been more of a challenge. I think I could get better at recognizing the syntax and learning about when to use which constructors when. Another thing that was more of a struggle for me was learning about object oriented coding. As of now I feel more confident recognizing when a class is being used, how to initialize my own class, what attributes and methods are, and how to develop my own methods to classes. I also feel better about inheritance frmo other classes and how to use that. I think I could get better and recognizing what the actual algortithmns are doing for the code and learning about the different built in methods that Java has. I think another strength I have gotten better at this trimester is going persistent and working to make sure that the code works as it is supposed. I was backend developer this trimester, so I had to figure out a lot of API issues and how to fetch data from the backend to the frontend. I struggled a lot with small syntax errors which would break my code a lot. Something that I hope to get better at next trimester is the deployment part of our website. This trimester I did not deploy and work with deployment as much as I would have liked to, so I am hoping that next trimester I can work on that.</p>
